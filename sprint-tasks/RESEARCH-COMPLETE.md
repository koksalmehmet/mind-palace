## 🔑 Key Concepts Explained Simply

### Signals
**What:** Values that notify when they change  
**Why:** No boilerplate subscriptions, automatic cleanup  
**Simple Example:**
```typescript
const count = signal(0);           // Create
const doubled = computed(() => count() * 2);  // Derive
count.set(5);                      // Update
console.log(doubled());            // Get: 10
```

### OnPush Change Detection
**What:** Only update component when inputs change  
**Why:** 70% fewer updates, better performance  
**Result:** With signals, automatic integration

### Lazy Loading Routes
**What:** Load route components only when user visits  
**Why:** Smaller initial download, faster startup  
**Example:**
```typescript
{ path: 'analysis', loadComponent: () => import('./analysis') }
```

### Vitest
**What:** Modern, fast test runner (Jest-compatible)  
**Why:** 5x faster, better DX, ESM-native  
**Switch From:** Karma (slower, less DX)

### TypeScript Strict
**What:** Compiler flags that enforce type safety  
**Why:** Prevent entire class of runtime bugs  
**Current:** 95% → **Target:** 100%

## 💬 Common Questions

**Q: Will this break our app?**  
A: No. Changes are additive. We run old Karma tests alongside Vitest during transition.

**Q: How long is the implementation?**  
A: 2-3 weeks for full implementation. Start week of Jan 13 for end of month completion.

**Q: Do we have to rewrite all components?**  
A: No. Components stay mostly the same; we refactor to use signals instead of subscriptions.

**Q: What if we find issues during implementation?**  
A: Reference the troubleshooting section in the checklist. Or ask in #angular-21-upgrade Slack channel.

**Q: Can we rollback if needed?**  
A: Yes. All changes are in separate branch. Can revert in minutes if needed.

**Q: Does the team need training?**  
A: Yes, included. 2-3 workshops + documentation + pair programming.
